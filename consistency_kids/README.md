# The development of consistent decision-making across economic domains

In this repository you will find: 

1. [Software](https://github.com/labelinstitute/dev_DM/tree/main/consistency_kids/Software). Multistage is developed at SSEL at Caltech. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jp9XA6YVJm3eW9_c4rYbBQtlSfmJg9XO/view) are short instructions to run it. You first need to set up a network with your computers. The metadata folder contains a general version for children grades and up and adults (the Matching Game), and a simplified version for younger children (the Owl and Frog Game). The software also contains code for the Dice Game which was administered in the same experiment (results reported [here](http://isabellebrocas.org/Research/lying.pdf)). *LABEL does not provide assistance if the experimental software is not compatible with newer versions. Experimenters should seek support from the developer and make the appropriate adjustments to the code.*
