# Steps of reasoning in children and adolescents

In this repository you will find: 

1. [Software](https://github.com/labelinstitute/dev_DM/tree/main/Dice_Game/Software). Multistage is developed at SSEL at Caltech. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jp9XA6YVJm3eW9_c4rYbBQtlSfmJg9XO/view) are short instructions to run it. You first need to set up a network with your computers. •	The metadata folder contains a general version for children grades and up and adults (the Matching Game), and a simplified version for younger children (the Owl and Frog Game). *LABEL does not provide assistance if the experimental software is not compatible with newer versions. Experimenters should seek support from the developer and make the appropriate adjustments to the code.* The software also contains code for the Dice Game which was administered in the same experiment (results reported [here](http://isabellebrocas.org/Research/lying.pdf))
