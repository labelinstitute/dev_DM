You first need to set up a network with your computers. *LABEL does not provide assistance if the experimental software is not compatible with newer versions. Experimenters should seek support from the developer and make the appropriate adjustments to the code.* The software also contains code for the Matching Game which was administered in the same experiment (results reported [here](http://isabellebrocas.org/Research/levelkids.pdf))
